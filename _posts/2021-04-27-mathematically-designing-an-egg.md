title: mathematically designing an egg
---

>Eggs are oval shaped objects with their form varying among species in symmetry
>and ellipticity. An oval is loosely defined as a squashed ellipse that
>usually (not required) is pointier at one end, that is it has only one
>symmetry axis. This article will attempt to intuitively design a few such
>shapes, utilizing the computer algebra system Maxima.
