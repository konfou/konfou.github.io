title: Yu-Gi-Oh! card game for classic anime viewers
---

By Mid 2000s  Yu-Gi-Oh!  had become huge  in the west in  part thanks to
the [Yu-Gi-Oh!][yp-anime],  in Japan known as  Yu-Gi-Oh!  Duel Monsters,
anime dubbed  by 4Kids.  Lots  of kids  grew up watching  it, collecting
cards, and  playing the  card game.  Though  new Yu-Gi-Oh!   anime shows
continued  to be  produced after  the legendary  Atem vs  Yugi duel  the
viewer base was nowhere near the scale of the original[^o].

Wanting to check the state of the  game, one and half decade later, with
only knowledge being the game back  then, this post will quickly explain
mechanics and monsters introduced since.   The canonical sources are the
[guides][ygo-rb] provided by Konami which provide an overview of the all
the following.   For in-depth  information on the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  franchise,
compiling multiple  sources, there's [Yugipedia], a  wiki[^w] written by
fans.

## Extra deck

The _extra deck_  contains monsters that can be special  summoned in the
_extra monster  zone_.  The  extra monster  zone is  shared for  the two
duelists but  normally only one  of the two  positions can be  used from
each  one.  It replaced  the  _fusion  deck_  when synchro  monster  got
introduced.  Before  then fusion  and  ritual  monsters where  the  only
monsters that could be special  summoned.  For reminder, fusion monsters
require  specific  monsters, called  _fusion  materials_,  and a  fusion
summoning  card  such   as,  the  known  from  the   anime,  {%  include
ygocard.html  search='Polymerization' %}.   Ritual monsters  are special
summoned with a  specific ritual summoning card.  In  contrast to fusion
and all other special summoned monsters, ritual monster cards are placed
in the main deck.

## Synchro

An evolution of traditional fusion was, the distinct from fusion summon,
{% include yugipedia.html  page='Contact Fusion' %}, a  type of built-in
special summon.  Requiring  only the appropriate card in  the extra deck
and monsters on the field, it  can be considered a precursor to _synchro
summon_.

A {%  include yugipedia.html  page='Synchro Monster'  %} can  be synchro
summoned from the extra deck by sending one _Tuner_ monster and a number
of  other monsters  to the  graveyard if  their sum  (tuner and  others)
equals the  synchro monster's  level.  Some  synchro monsters  require a
specific Tuner  monster.  The requirements  for each are written  in the
card  description text.   Although summoning  is normally  done in  main
phase, some  cards have effects  that allow  summoning to take  place at
time other than summoner's main phase when the {% include yugipedia.html
page='game state' %} is open.

Synchro-based  decks utilize  numerous monsters  for rapid  power taking
advantage of their summoning method.  Though powerful they aren't simple
to   play  requiring   balancing   tuners   and  non-tuners.    Although
synchro-centric  decks became  popular,  other  decks remained  relevant
after synchros got introduced.

Their history  in the game,  alongside some once popular  strategies, is
described a nice [article  on Cardmarket][cm-sm].  The article concludes
that synchro monsters  are well represented in current  format and still
relevant.

## Xyz

A  {%  include yugipedia.html  page='Xyz  Monster'  %} can  be  summoned
whenever monsters of  same level to its _rank_ are  controlled.  Rank is
the equivalent  to level  for those monsters.   Since they've  no level,
they aren't affected by level-dependent cards and effects.  The required
monsters for its  summoning, called _materials_, are listed  at its card
description text. It  is summoned by stacking the  materials and placing
the Xyz Monster atop of them.

Some Xyz  Monster have effects that  can take place by  having materials
_detached_, that  is having at least  one of its material  is moved from
the stack to the graveyard.

Many  considered them  broken  due  to their  ease  of summoning.   They
require no specific  monsters, no extra spell card, no  tuners, and even
those having requirements are pretty  generic.  As such they've become a
must  in competitive  setting (meta  decks) yet  no skill  or effort  or
strategy was needed  for their use.  For disqussions on  that aspect see
https://redd.it/2gn4vt and https://redd.it/5f6qhw (threads on r/yugioh).

## Pendulum

A  monster/spell hybrid.   A  {%  include yugipedia.html  page='Pendulum
 Monster' %} can  be summoned as monsters or activated  like spell cards
 in the _pendulum zone_.  Not all  pendulum monsters have a spell or/and
 monster  effect.  They  have a  _pendulum scale_  that determines  what
 monster levels can be special summoned during a pendulum summon.

During the main  phase a pendulum monster can be  activated (one) in the
leftmost and (one in the) rightmost  spell & trap zone.  These positions
become the pendulum zone.  After  having one in each, pendulum summoning
can take  place.  Then  any number  of monsters  from hand  and pendulum
monsters from extra deck with level between (exclusive) the two pendulum
ratings, called the _pendulum scale_, can be special summoned.

Pendulum monsters cannot be completely  destroyed.  Whenever one is sent
from the field  to the graveyard, it's placed face-up  in the extra deck
instead. That means they can be re-used as normal.

Their utilization  is similar to  synchros. Numerous monsters  for rapid
power.  Their  main weakness lies  in their dependence to  their scales.
If the  opponent cannot get  rid of the  scales they become  a nuisance.
Many  consider them  badly designed  as they  considerably speed  up the
game. Duels  with them are  win or lose  in few turns.   Nevertheless in
competitive setting  they're considered  underpowered compared  to other
types.

Because  it  allows  to  bring  many monsters  to  the  field,  pendulum
summoning can  be used to  gather material  for others forms  of special
summoning.   Even decks  that  aren't pendulum-centric  can utilize  the
pendulum mechanic for that.

## Link

A {% include yugipedia.html page='Link  Monster' %} applies effects that
its lit-up  red _link  arrows_ point  to.  The number  of the  arrows is
equal to the  number of monsters required to summon  it.  This number is
called _link rating_.   It is summoned from the extra  deck by using the
materials written  at its card description  text.  They do not  have DEF
rating and can never be in defense position. Taking control of one moves
it to the  main monster zone and when  it goes back this is  the zone it
goes to.

Link Monsters  can be used to  increase the number of  monsters summoned
from the  extra deck.  Monsters summoned  from the extra deck  go in the
extra monster zone  but every monster in the main  monster zone that has
link pointed  to it,  can be  used to summon  monsters from  extra deck.
Before their introduction, monsters special summoned from the extra deck
were placed  in the main  monster zone and  were unrestricted. On  a way
their introduction nerfs Synchro, Xyz, and Pendulum summoning. They also
introduce the need for strategic planning of where cards will be placed.

Their  summoning  makes   it  simpler  to  summon   link  monsters  with
increasingly  higher link  rating.  Normally  one monster  is one  _link
material_, but when a Link Monster is  used as link material this can be
counted  as one  monster or  the number  of monsters  equal to  its link
rating.

## Conclusion

The  game nowadays  is  much faster  than  it used  to  be.  Cards  have
multiple effects  and turns  are more  complex. A  guide is  provided on
r/Yugioh101  at  https://redd.it/edjjit  with information  for  new  and
returning players.   This post can be  thought as covering section  2 in
this guide. Reading various comments, it seems the (official) Duel Links
game is  close to what  the TCG used  to be years  ago. But even  it has
become faster by introducing some of the aforementioned mechanics.
