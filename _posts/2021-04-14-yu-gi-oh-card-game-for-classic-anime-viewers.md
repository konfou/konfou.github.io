title: Yu-Gi-Oh! card game for classic anime viewers
---

By Mid 2000s  Yu-Gi-Oh!  had become huge  in the west in  part thanks to
the [Yu-Gi-Oh!][yp-anime],  in Japan known as  Yu-Gi-Oh!  Duel Monsters,
anime dubbed  by 4Kids.  Lots  of kids  grew up watching  it, collecting
cards, and  playing the  card game.  Though  new Yu-Gi-Oh!   anime shows
continued  to be  produced after  the legendary  Atem vs  Yugi duel  the
viewer base was nowhere near the scale of the original[^o].

This was  the time  that many  viewers played the  game dropping  it few
years  later.  Wanting  to check  the state  of the  game, one  and half
decades later, with  only knowledge being the game back  then, this post
will  quickly  explain mechanics  and  monsters  introduced since.   The
canonical  sources are  the  [guides][ygo-rb] provided  by Konami  which
provide an overview of the  all the following.  For in-depth information
on  the  Yu-Gi-Oh!   franchise,   compiling  multiple  sources,  there's
[Yugipedia], a wiki[^w] written by fans.

## Extra deck

The _extra deck_  contains monsters that can be special  summoned in the
_main monster zone_ and _extra monster zone_.  The extra monster zone is
shared for the  two duelists but normally only one  of the two positions
can be used  from each one.  It replaced the  _fusion deck_ when synchro
monster got  introduced.  Before then  fusion and ritual  monsters where
the only monsters that could  be special summoned.  For reminder, fusion
monsters  require specific  monsters, called  _fusion materials_,  and a
fusion summoning  card such  as, the  known from  the anime,  {% include
ygocard.html  search='Polymerization' %}.   Ritual monsters  are special
summoned with a  specific ritual summoning card.  In  contrast to fusion
and all other special summoned monsters, ritual monster cards are placed
in the main deck.

## Synchro

An evolution of traditional fusion was, the distinct from fusion summon,
{% include yugipedia.html  page='Contact Fusion' %}, a  type of built-in
special summon.  Requiring  only the appropriate card in  the extra deck
and monsters on the field, it  can be considered a precursor to _synchro
summon_.

A {%  include yugipedia.html  page='Synchro Monster'  %} can  be synchro
summoned from the extra deck by sending one _Tuner_ monster and a number
of  other monsters  to the  graveyard if  their sum  (tuner and  others)
equals the  synchro monster's  level.  Some  synchro monsters  require a
specific Tuner  monster.  The requirements  for each are written  in the
card  description text.   Although summoning  is normally  done in  main
phase, some  cards have effects  that allow  summoning to take  place at
time other than summoner's main phase when the {% include yugipedia.html
page='game state' %} is open.

Synchro-centric decks  utilize numerous monsters for  rapid power taking
advantage of their summoning method.  Though powerful they aren't simple
to   play  requiring   balancing   tuners   and  non-tuners.    Although
synchro-centric  decks became  popular,  other  decks remained  relevant
after they got introduced.

Synchro brought forth  radical game changes shifting focus  to the extra
deck. Their history in the game, alongside some once popular strategies,
is  described  a  nice  [article  on  Cardmarket][cm-sm].   The  article
concludes that synchro  monsters are well represented  in current format
and still relevant.

## Xyz

A  {%  include yugipedia.html  page='Xyz  Monster'  %} can  be  summoned
whenever monsters of  same level to its _rank_ are  controlled.  Rank is
the equivalent  to level  for those monsters.   Since they've  no level,
they aren't affected by level-dependent cards and effects.  The required
monsters for its  summoning, called _materials_, are listed  at its card
description text. It  is summoned by stacking the  materials and placing
the Xyz Monster atop of them.

Some Xyz  Monster have effects that  can take place by  having materials
_detached_, that  is having at least  one of its material  is moved from
the stack to the graveyard.

Some  considered them  broken  due  to their  ease  of summoning.   They
require no specific  monsters, no extra spell card, no  tuners, and even
those having requirements are pretty  generic.  As such they've become a
must  in competitive  setting (meta  decks) yet  no skill  or effort  or
strategy  was needed  for their  use.  See  <https://redd.it/2gn4vt> and
<https://redd.it/5f6qhw> (threads on r/yugioh) for relevant discussions.

## Pendulum

A  monster/spell hybrid.   A  {%  include yugipedia.html  page='Pendulum
 Monster' %} can  be summoned as monsters or activated  like spell cards
 in the _pendulum zone_.  Not all  pendulum monsters have a spell or/and
 monster  effect.  They  have a  _pendulum scale_  that determines  what
 monster levels can be special summoned during a pendulum summon.

During the main  phase a pendulum monster can be  activated (one) in the
leftmost and (one in the) rightmost  spell & trap zone.  These positions
become the pendulum zone.  After  having one in each, pendulum summoning
can take  place.  Then  any number  of monsters  from hand  and pendulum
monsters from extra deck with level between (exclusive) the two pendulum
ratings, called the  _pendulum scale_, can be  special summoned. Monster
special summoned from the extra deck  have to be placed to extra monster
zone.

Pendulum monsters cannot be completely  destroyed.  Whenever one is sent
from the field  to the graveyard, it's placed face-up  in the extra deck
instead. That means they can be re-used as normal.

Their  utilization can  be similar  to synchros.  Numerous monsters  for
rapid  power.  Their  main weakness  lies in  their dependence  to their
scales.  If  the opponent  cannot get  rid of the  scales they  become a
nuisance.  Many consider them badly  designed as they considerably speed
up the game. Duels with them are win or lose in few turns.  Nevertheless
in competitive setting they're considered underpowered compared to other
types.

Because  it  allows  to  bring  many monsters  to  the  field,  pendulum
summoning  can also  be  used to  gather material  for  others forms  of
special summoning.  Even decks  that aren't pendulum-centric can utilize
the pendulum mechanic for that.

## Link

A {% include yugipedia.html page='Link  Monster' %} applies effects that
its lit-up  red _link  arrows_ point  to.  The number  of the  arrows is
equal to the  number of monsters required to summon  it.  This number is
called _link rating_.   It is summoned from the extra  deck by using the
materials written  at its card description  text.  They do not  have DEF
rating and can never be in defense position. Taking control of one moves
it to the  main monster zone and when  it goes back this is  the zone it
goes to.

Link Monsters have to  placed to the extra monster zone  but they can be
used to  increase that number.   Every main  monster zone that  has link
pointed to it can function as an extra monster zone.

For few years  after their introduction, every  monster special summoned
from the extra deck  had to be summoned to an extra main  zone. On a way
their  introduction nerfed  Synchro, Xyz,  and Pendulum  summoning. They
also introduced the  need for strategic planning of where  cards will be
placed. The decision  was nevertheless reverted last year  for all extra
decks summonings besides Pendulum and Link.

Their  summoning  makes   it  simpler  to  summon   link  monsters  with
increasingly  higher link  rating.  Normally  one monster  is one  _link
material_, but when a Link Monster is  used as link material this can be
counted  as one  monster or  the number  of monsters  equal to  its link
rating.

## Rules

Besides mechanics, some rule changes have taken place. Most of them make
sense and it is how someone with  no prior knowledge of the game will've
expected them to be.

 * The player  who goes first cannot  draw during the draw  phase of the
   first turn. That is all players start with five cards.

 * The decks  have limits at them. Main  deck has to be 40  to 60 cards.
   Extra deck is limited to 15 cards.  Side deck is limited to 15 cards.

 * Both  players may control  an active _field_  spell card at  the same
   time. A  field card can be  replaced by sending the  currently active
   field  card  to  the  graveyard.  The  old  card  is  not  considered
   destroyed.

 * After a  chain or summon has finished resolving,  the turn player can
   only activate a _fast effect_ before the opponent can.

 * If during the  battle step the target is removed from  the field or a
   new monster is placed onto opponent's field before the damage step, a
   _replay_ is caused. If another monster is chosen to attack, the first
   monster is still considered to have declared an attack.

 * A  continuous trap card can  have its quick-like effect  activated at
   the same time as the card itself.

 * If  game rules provide  the required information to  resolve effects,
   that effect is  not allowed to be activated  (illegal).  Examples are
   hand and deck revelations or deck searches.

 * Monsters equipped to monsters  are destroyed if the monster-equipping
   monster is destroyed.

 * The battle position of a monster  that was played onto the field this
   turn cannot change.

 * Two attack position monsters with 0 ATK that battle each other are not
   destroyed.

Also keep  in mind that some  cards have their card  texts updated.  The
cards  that had  their effects  changed can  be found  [on the  official
site][ygo-uct].

## Alternative formats

To me, an old (casual) player, the (few) rule updates make sense and the
new   mechanics,   if   it   wasn't  for   their   splashability,   seem
interesting. But powercreep,  although expected, seems to  have become a
significant problem. Especially with the numerous cards having some kind
of negation effect, monsters combining effects that in past required two
or more,  and hand traps prevalence.   Basically games now seem  to boil
down to who  will draw the correct card first  something that very often
happens in first turn (too luck dependent).

In general, the game nowadays is much faster and complex than it used to
be. Reading various comments, it seems the (official) Duel Links game is
close  to  what  the TCG  used  to  be  years  ago.  But  even  that  is
introducing the aforementioned mechanics.

The  following  alternative   formats  are  unofficial  community-driven
formats  that shift  game  focus and  emphasize  different concepts  and
skills   to  standard   (current;   referring  to   both  advanced   and
traditional). Compared they're practically a different game.

### Goat

[Goat] refers to the format  officially played during 2005's summer, and
is widely played today.  It is named after the dominant deck of its era,
about which  there's [an in-depth article][ygpd-gc]  on YGOPRODECK about
it. It uses the same card pool, ruleset, and banlist as back then.  [Its
rules][goat-rules]  are  basically  the  reverse of  what  mentioned  in
previous section.

<!--
 1. The player who goes first draws in the first turn.
 2. The main and fusion deck have no upper limit.
 3. Only one field spell can be active to the field.
 4. Monster ignition effects have same priority as fast effects.
 5. Replay mechanic is not a redirection but a rewind.
 6. Continuous traps cannot activate  their ignition-like effects at the
    same time they're flipped up.
 7. Revelations happen even if rules provide required information.
 8. Deck search cards can be used without any legal options.
 9. Only one chain can be formed during a damage sub-step.
 10. A match draw can happen.
 11. Triggers can be recognized as being met in the middle of a chain.
 12.  Monsters equipped to monsters are not destroyed.
 13. Controlled opponent  monster can change its battle  position in the
     turn it was summoned.
 14. Two monsters with 0 ATK do destroy each other.
-->

There're [few  reasons][goat-why] why  someone would  like to  play this
format. It rewards  strategic skill as the winning  position is achieved
over a longer game.  Although a static and smaller card pool is utilized
a variety  of styles are considered  viable. On the other  hand the less
technical skill required, lack of aforementioned mechanics, smaller card
variance in decks, and its static nature may be a turn off for some.

Similarly to Goat, there're formats  (also named after the dominant meta
deck  of their  era)  using card  pool, ruleset,  and  banlist of  other
years. Those are less popular but they also have people playing them.

### Nova

[Nova] is a  classically-inspired format borrowing game  ideas from Goat
but exhibiting greater card diversity  (yet having a drastically smaller
card pool)  and the Synchro and  Xyz mechanics. The card  pool was built
from scratch  chosen after a long  list of guiding principles  (refer to
its site).

A lot of  work seems to have go  into it but it's still  young to become
apparent for whether it really works or meta will end up being dominated
by a handful decks as current. Also it appears to be relatively unknown.

### Trinity

Rather  changing  the card  pool  or  choosing  an older  year  banlist,
[Trinity] introduces an unlimited,  semi-forbidden and co-forbidden card
list   and  modifies   the   standard  ruleset   with  [few   additional
rules][trinity-rules].

 * Neither player can normal or special summon effect monsters more than
   3 times each  turn. This doesn't refer to the  number of monsters but
   the act of summoning.

 *  By  default  there  can  be  only one  copy  of  each  card  in  the
   decks. Unbound  cards are excepted to  3 copies. Those are  normal or
   non-effect monsters, cards that  reference themselves, and cards that
   cards that share a name.

 * The minimum main deck size is reduced to 30. The upper limit remains.

 * For  every 5 cards  above the minimum main  deck size, that  deck may
   include 1  extra unlimited  card **or** 1  semi-forbidden (one-point)
   card **or** 2 co-forbidden (half-point) cards.

Trinity has  an active player base  and a dynamic nature  in contrast to
previous-years  alternative  formats.   The  rules  introduce  an  extra
tactical consideration and games become lengthier compared to standard.

## Conclusion

A  guide is  provided  on r/Yugioh101  at <https://redd.it/edjjit>  with
information for new and returning players.   This post can be thought as
covering section 2 in this guide, alongside some extra information.

On  YGOPRODEK,  Meepmoto27  has  written  a  series  of  posts  covering
extensively  the  metagame  from  the  game's  inception  up  to  recent
years[[1]][[2]][[3]][[4]][[5]]. Synchro,  Xyz, and Pendulum  are covered
in third, fourth, and fifth post respectively.

Finally it worths  noting how Yu-Gi-Oh!, an eternal  format trading card
game, has  survived and remained  playable for that long.   Other games,
such as the  also popular Magic, have a rotation  format that only cards
in  sets  released   within  a  span  of  few   years  are  (tournament)
playable. Something  that allows  a better  fine-tuning. In  contrast in
Yu-Gi-Oh!   old cards  can  interact  with new  ones  in  ways that  the
designers weren't expecting. Something that is also interesting although
not that important in this era.
