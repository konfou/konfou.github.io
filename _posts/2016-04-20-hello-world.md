This is the  first post on this Jekyll-based GitHub-hosted  blog.  It is
based  on [@benburwell's  site][benburwell] ([archived])  whose homepage
looks like and actually is a JSON  file (cool). I've modified it to look
like Guile (Scheme  dialect) local variable binding  (also cool?).  Also
I've  changed the  color scheme  to  (hopefully) match  my all  favorite
[Zenburn] and  changed font to  justified monospace (for  improved coder
look).

My interests are mathematics, physics (being a physics major that was to
be expected), astronomy, programming as well  as anything that has to do
with Unix or Unix-like systems (mainly GNU/Linux).  Last, but not least,
I'm an avid anime/manga fan.

Concluding, most probably  this blog's content will be  based upon those
mentioned interests.
