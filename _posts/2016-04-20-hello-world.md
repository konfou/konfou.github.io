This is the  first post on this Jekyll-based Github-hosted  blog.  It is
based on @[benburwell]'s [site].

My interests are mathematics, physics (being a physics major that was to
be expected), astronomy, programming as well  as anything that has to do
with Unix or Unix-like systems (mainly GNU/Linux).  Last, but not least,
I'm an avid anime/manga fan.

Concluding, most probably  this blog's content will be  based upon those
mentioned interests.
