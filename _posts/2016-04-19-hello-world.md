title: Hello, World!

Hello, World! This is the first post on this Jekyll-based Github-hosted blog.
It is based on @[benburwell][]'s [site][].

My interests are physics, mathematics (being a Physics major that was to be expected),
as well as anything that has to do with Unix or Unix-like systems (mainly GNU/Linux).
Last but not least I'm an avid anime/manga fan.

Concluding, most probably this blog's content will be based upon those mentioned interests.
